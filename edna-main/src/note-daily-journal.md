# Daily Journal

Daily journal is where you can:

* record what you did every day
* write your daily thoughts and ideas

To make it easier to use we auto-create a block for the current day at the top of the note.

The format of the block is: `# YYYY-MM-DD DayOfWeek`

`Alt + 2` is default quick access shortcut for Inbox note.

If you don't care about inbox note, delete it with:

* right-click for context menu, `Note / Delete current note`
* `Mod + P` for note selector, position on inbox and `Mod + Delete`

You can re-create `daily journal` note in the future.
